# ComfyUI-CaptionThis  

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)  

**ComfyUI-CaptionThis** is a flexible tool for generating image descriptions, built to support multiple powerful captioning models such as **Janus Pro**, with future integration of additional models such as **Florence2**, **JoyCaption**, and any future models. Designed to simplify workflows for **image-to-image tasks** and **dataset preparation for LoRA** or similar fine-tuning purposes, this tool provides an intuitive way to describe single images or batch process entire directories.  

Special thanks to [DeepSeek-AI](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus) for contributing the robust **Janus Pro** model, and to [CY-CHENYUE](https://github.com/CY-CHENYUE/ComfyUI-Janus-Pro) for integrating Janus Pro within ComfyUI. This project builds on their contributions and introduces a **multi-model architecture**, enabling users to select the best model for their specific needs.

## Features

1. **Single Image Description**  
   Generate detailed captions for a single image using your preferred model. Users can input an image and optionally provide specific prompts or guiding questions to enrich the description.  

2. **Batch Caption Generation**  
   Automate the captioning of images in a specified directory. For each image, a corresponding description is generated and saved as a `.txt` file, making dataset preparation efficient and straightforward.  

3. **Multi-Model Support**  
   The system is designed to integrate multiple captioning models, offering users the flexibility to choose based on their tasks. Currently, it supports **Janus Pro**, with future updates planned to include additional models to enhance functionality and coverage.

## Coming Soon  

- Integration with new models (e.g., **Florence2**, **JoyCaption**) to further expand capabilities and adapt to different use cases.  
- Advanced configuration options for fine-tuning caption outputs tailored to user requirements.
